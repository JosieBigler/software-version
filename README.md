# software-version
Simple software version displaying and searching website using MVC and .NET 5 

Things I would implement with more time. 

1. Pagination of results. While the initial list is small, it would likely grow large. 
2. Search for Software name as well as version. 
3. Given public data and a small list, I would implement with plain JavaScript and HTML, so you can host for close to free. 

Ways to extend the original idea 

1. Save historical versions of Software.  So Visual Studios would show 2 versions of itself, rather than as 2 seperate Software Programs. 
2. Add Create, Update, and Delete functionality.  This would probably require some level of authentication to prevent malicious users. 
3. Hyperlink Software to redirect to their download page.  So Visual studios would link to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
